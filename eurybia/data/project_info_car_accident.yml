General information:
  Version: 0.1
  Name: Car accident DataDrift Analysis
  Purpose: Analyse drift between learning and production dataset
  Date: auto
  Contributors: Thomas Bouche, Nicolas Roux, Johann Martin
  Description: Make sure that both datasets has the same properties
  Source code: https://github.com/MAIF/eurybia

Dataset information:
  Path: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/version/10
  Origin: Kaggle datasets
  Description: Dataset of Car accident to predict severity of accident
  Depth: accidents between 2016 and 2020
  Perimeter: Samples from both learning and production datasets.
  Target feature: Cible by transforming Severity in two class 0 and 1
  Target description: 0 for a less severe accident and 1 for a severe accident

Data Preparation:
  Feature filtering: All features that requiring special knowledge or previous calculations were removed
  Individual filtering: random sample
  Missing values: were replaced by 0
  Feature engineering: No feature was created. All features are directly taken from the kaggle dataset. Categorical features were transformed using an ordinal encoder.
