General information:
  version: 0.1
  name: Car accident DataDrift Analysis
  purpose: Analyse drift between learning dataset and production
  date: auto
  contributors: Thomas Bouche, Nicolas Roux, Johann Martin
  description: Make sure that both datasets has the same properties
  source code: https://github.com/MAIF/eurybia
  Git commit: ..

Dataset information:
  path:
  origin: Datasets from production and from development session
  description: Dataset of Car accident to predict severity of accident
  depth: Unknown
  perimeter: sample from both production and learning datasets
  target variable: Cible
  target description: 0 for a less severe accident and 1 for a severe accident

Data Preparation:
  variable filetring: All variables that required special knowledge or previous calculations for their use were removed
  individual filtering: random sample
  missing values: were replaced by 0
  Feature engineering: No feature was created. All features are directly taken from the kaggle dataset. Categorical features were transformed using an ordinal encoder.

Model training:
  Used algorithm: We used a catboost algorithm
  Parameters choice: We did not perform any hyperparameter optimisation
  Metrics: Mean Squared Error metric
  Validation strategy: We splitted our data into train (75%) and test (25%)
