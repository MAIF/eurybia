Dataset information:
  path:
  origin: Datasets from production and from development session
  description: Dataset of house price for a regression model
  depth: Unknown
  perimeter: sample from both production and learning datasets

Data Preparation:
  variable filetring: All variables that required special knowledge or previous calculations for their use were removed
  individual filtering: random sample
